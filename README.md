# Plonkish Constraint Systems

As part of the [ZKProof standardization effort](https://zkproof.org), the
Plonkish Constraint System Working Group is developing a specification, a
reference implementation written in Rust, and test vectors for
*Plonkish arithmetisation*.

See also [Mary's presentation about the Plonkish Working Group](https://zkproof.org/2023/09/12/plonk-standardization-zkproof-5-5-mary-maller-talk-summary/).

Plonkish arithmetisation is a means of expressing circuits for probabilistic
and/or zero-knowledge proving systems. This arithmetisation was originally
developed in the context of the [PLONK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953)
proving system, and refined for use in the [Halo 2](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/)
proving system. The variant of Plonkish used by Halo 2 is the initial focus
for this standardization effort.
